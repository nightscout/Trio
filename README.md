# Trio

## Introduction

Trio - an automated insulin delivery system for iOS based on the OpenAPS algorithm with [adaptations for Trio](https://github.com/nightscout/trio-oref).

The project started as Ivan Valkou's [FreeAPS X](https://github.com/ivalkou/freeaps) implementation of the [OpenAPS algorithm](https://github.com/openaps/oref0) for iPhone, and was later forked and rebranded as iAPS. The project has since seen substantial contributions from many developers, leading to a range of new features and enhancements.

Following the release of iAPS version 3.0.0, due to differing views on development, open source, and peer review, there was a significant shift in the project's direction. This led to the separation from the [Artificial-Pancreas/iAPS](https://github.com/Artificial-Pancreas/iAPS) repository, and the birth of [Trio](https://github.com/nightscout/Trio.git) as a distinct entity. This transition marks a new phase for the project, symbolizing both its evolution and the dynamic nature of collaborative development.

Trio continues to leverage a variety of frameworks from the DIY looping community and remains at the forefront of DIY diabetes management solutions, constantly evolving with valuable contributions from its community.

## To download this repo:

You can either use the Build Script or you can run each command manually.

### Build Script:

If you copy, paste, and run the following script in Terminal, it will guide you through downloading and installing Trio. More information about the script can be found [here](https://docs.diy-trio.org/en/latest/operate/build.html#build-trio-with-script).

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loopandlearn/lnl-scripts/main/TrioBuildSelectScript.sh)"
```

### Command Line Interface (CLI):

In Terminal, `cd` to the folder where you want your download to reside, change `<branch>` in the command below to the branch you want to download (ie. `dev`), and press `return`.

```
git clone --branch=<branch> --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nightscout/Trio.git && cd Trio
```

Create a ConfigOverride.xcconfig file that contains your Apple Developer ID (something like `123A4BCDE5`). This will automate signing of the build targets in Xcode:

Copy the command below, and replace `xxxxxxxxxx` by your Apple Developer ID before running the command in Terminal.
```
echo 'DEVELOPER_TEAM = xxxxxxxxxx' > ConfigOverride.xcconfig
```

Then launch Xcode and build the Trio app:
```
xed .
```
